</div>

<!-- getConfiguration -->
<div class="section">
    <h1><span class="mono">getConfiguration()</span></h1>

    {{ scythe.reference('getConfiguration()', 'scythe.js') }}

    <p>This function returns a plain JavaScript object to be used as the
      configuration object for making a static site out the current
      directory. It operates by reading the <code>config.yml</code> file and parsing it into a
      JavaScript object, for any configuration property that is not set in
      the parsed object a default value is used.</p>

    <p>This function implements the promise interface.</p>
    
</div>

<!-- parseFiles -->
<div class="section">
  <h1><span class="mono">parseFiles()</span></h1>

  {{ scythe.reference('parseFiles()', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>This function returns a list with what we call "file description
    objects" for each of the files and subdirectories of the current
    working directory. A file description object is a literal JavaScript
    object that contains all the information that Scythe needs in order
    to create a static site out the contents of the cwd. The properties
    of the file description objects includes things such as the type of
    file, or the absolute path to which it's render output should be
    written to (if applicable).</p>

  <p>The function make use of the <code>fse.walk</code> function,
    which will walk down the current directory asynchronously,
    emitting an event each time a file is encountered. With the
    emitted event the method already provides an object with some
    properties about the file in question, we just extend those
    properties with our own to finish making a file description
    object.</p>

  <p>The function depends on a numbr of inner functions to determine
    the type of file, this determination occurs during the
    walking-down-the-dir process.  These inner functions are detailed
    next.</p>

  <h2><span class="mono">categorizeFile()</span></h2>

  {{ scythe.reference('categorizeFile()', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>This inner function makes tests the possible types of a file at a
    given path. The tests are themselves functions. The first test
    that returns truth will determine the type. The corresponding file
    type constant is returned.</p>

  <h2><span class="mono">filepathIsSpecial()</span></h2>

  {{ scythe.reference('filepathIsSpecial()', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>This function testes whether the file at a given filepath is of
    type "special", as a reminder, special-type files are those that
    won't appear in the static site and are used to give additional data
    or instructions to the Scythe program. The test is made by checking
    if the filepaths base directory is contained within the list of
    special file paths. Only the base name is checked as any child of a
    special file will also be special.</p>

  <h2><span class="mono">filepathIsPage()</span></h2>

  {{ scythe.reference('filepathIsPage()', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>A file is determined to be of type page if it has the .html
    extension. (This implies that that the file isn't already
    determined to be of type special, so when testing the order
    matters.</p>

  <h2>Additional notes</h2>

  <p>There is no test to find out if a file is of type verbatim, as
    this will always be the case when the file is not of the other two
    types.</p>

  <p>This function implements the promise interface.</p>
</div>

<!-- makeSite -->
<div class="section">
  <h1><span class="mono">makeSite()</span></h1>  

  {{ scythe.reference('makeSite()', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>The <code>makeSite()</code> function takes the result of <code>parseFiles()</code>
    and the configuration object and actually creates the static site, with this we
    mean that it creates the static site directory, copies the verbatim files and
    writes the rendered output of the page-type files.</p>

  <p>The first thing that is done is instatiate the template
    engine. In it's constructor we pass a list of FileSystemLoaders,
    these are pointers to the directories where the template engine
    will look for the templates that are extended, included or imported
    from the page-type html files.</p>

  {{ scythe.reference('template engine instatiation', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>Then we extend the <code>engine.globals</code> property to make
    some other JavaScript objects and functions callable from the
    templates.</p>

  {{ scythe.reference('engine globals extension', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>An empty object is assigned to the <code>codeRegions</code> local
    variable. This will serve as a two-tier dictionary that will store
    the code regions of each of the source files. The first level will
    be the file name, and the second level will be the code region
    name. This object will be lazily populated whenever a code region
    is being referenced.</p>

  {{ scythe.reference('template engine context', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>Next we create an object and assign it to the <code>context</code> local
    variable, this object will be passed alongside with a template
    string whenever we are rendering a page-type file, it's purpose
    it's to make data available to the user in the template through
    <a href="{{ data.links.nunjucks }}">nunjucks</a> syntax.</p>

  {{ scythe.reference('code regions store', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>Then we begin iterating through the list of file description
    objects (see the <code>parseFiles()</code> method), and take
    action depending on it's type. Special-type files are ignored,
    page-type files are read, rendered with the template engine and
    written to their output destinations and verbatim files are copied
    into the output directory.</p>

  {{ scythe.reference('makeSite main loop', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>In addition, the function makes use of inner functions to accomplish
    the tasks of parsing the contents of the special <code>_data/</code> directory
    and to parse and retrieve code regions. These inner functions are
    detailed next.</p>

  <h2><span class="mono">parseDataDir()</span></h2>

  {{ scythe.reference('parseDataDir()', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>When the user has set up at least one .yml file inside of the special
    <code>_data/</code> directory, this function will return an object
    whose keys are the names of each of the .yml files (without the
    extension) and whose values are be the result obtained from
    parsing the file's contents.</p>

  <p>As a reminder, the <code>_data/</code> directory is there so that
    the user can put information to reference throughout their
    page-type files. For example, for all the links to third-party
    sites in this documentation we aren't actually typing the anchors
    href value, instead we are referencing by a given name a url we
    have set up in the <code>_data/links.yml</code> file.
  </p>

  <h2><span class="mono">getCodeRegion()</span></h2>

  {{ scythe.reference('getCodeRegion()', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>This function parameters are the name of a code region, and the
    file where the code region should be located at. When called, the
    function checks the closure-accessible variable <code>codeRegions</code>'s
    attribute that matches the given file, if it is undefined then the
    function will set it to the result of another function that will
    return a dictionary of all the code regions in the supplied
    file. In any case, the code region is looked up first by file and
    then by name, should it not be present an error message is printed
    to the console and put in the rendered html itself.
  </p>

  <h2><span class="mono">getCodeRegionsOfFile()</span></h2>

  {{ scythe.reference('getCodeRegionsOfFile()', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>This function opens the given file and finds all the matches for the two
    regular expressions that represent a code region demarcation. From the capture
    groups of the regular expresions matches a regions object is populated which is
    what will ultimately be returned.</p>

  <p>Initially a serious bug was present in this function as it did
    not take into consideration code regions that might appear inside
    other code regions. This was the case because the way the regular
    expresion match loop works is that it starts the next search at
    the ending of the previous match, it never checked
    inbetween. To correct this the regular expression's <code>lastIndex</code> attribute
    is set not at the ending position of the match, but at the position where the starting
    comment of the code region finishes.</p>

  {{ scythe.reference('getCodeRegionsOfFile recursive region enabler', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>If you are unfamiliar with the syntaxes and types of code regions make sure to
    revise the <a href="users.html">User's guide</a> first.</p>

  <h2><span class="mono">makeCodeRegionHtml()</span></h2>

  {{ scythe.reference('makeCodeRegionHtml()', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>This function takes as parameters the name of code region and the file where
    the code region should be located at. It returns the corresponding code but marked
    up with html (this is done by using the highlight.js library). The returned html,
    in conjunction with a css stylesheet will make the code appear syntax highlighted
    in the browser.</p>
</div>

<!-- copyBootstrapTemplate -->
<div class="section">
  <h1><span class="mono">copyBootstrapTemplate()</span></h1>

  {{ scythe.reference('copyBootstrapTemplate()', 'scythe.js') }}

  <p>This function copies the bootstrap's website lookalike input
  directory template into the current working directory with the name
  "docs". However, it first checks whether a "docs" directory already
  exists, in which case the user is prompted for it's overriding or
  the cancellation of the action.</p>
