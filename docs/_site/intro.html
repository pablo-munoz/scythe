  <h1>What is Scythe</h1>

  <p>Scythe is a NodeJS program that runs in the command line and
    whose purpose is to create static websites. It also has some
    literate programming capabilities (sort of).</p>

  <p>The part of Scythe that is a static website generator is very
    similar to other similar programs like
    <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> and <a href="http://wintersmith.io/">wintersmith</a>. However
    it is also different from the alternatives it is limited to only
    understanding html files, so you will not be able to write your
    pages in markdown or any other quasi-html.</p>

  <p>When we say the program has some literate programming
  functionality we mean that it is possible for the user to put a
  special html tag in the html files they write. These html tags, that
  we call markup code references (because they are references to code
  that are in a markup file), don't actually appear in the html output
  of the generated static site, in their place, the program copies the
  lines of code they reference and marks it up with some other html.
  This has the effect of making the referenced code appear in the
  browser, inside a box and syntax colored as it would be in a
  programming IDE.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h1>More on literate programming</h1>

  <p>Literate programming is a philosophy for writing software that
    emphasizes documentation. But even the term "documentation" falls
    short of what literate programming intends to do, since most
    documentation in the industry is some kind of program-generated
    description of the classes and functions of a computer program. In
    literate programming, writing a software system is more like writing
    a book that has embedded code, but whose ultimate purpose is to
    comunicate ideas from human to human.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h1>Motivation</h1>

  <p>This program was born out of my desire to create literate
    programming documents for my software systems. Initially I
    attempted to write literate programs in LaTeX, however the
    resulting PDF files turned out to be a bit of a turnoff, since I
    had grown accostumed to the great online documentation of some
    technologies such as the Twitter's Bootstrap CSS framework and the
    NodeJS standard libraries documentation. In addition, since much
    of my work was about web applications and I had been championing
    the superiority of the browser as a medium, it seemed like a bit
    of a disconnect that the documentation of my software wasn't
    itself a webpage.</p>

  <p>Having settled on the decition that my software documentations
    would live in the web and being an avid Emacs user I explored it's
    major mode org as my programming environment. However, I never truly
    stopped feeling awkward and came to the following realizations:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Tools matter</dt>
    <dd>Although some people argue that all you need to program is
      Notepad or TextEdit, the truth, at least for me is that tools
      are not a pro but a must. Syntax coloring, code navigation and
      other such functionalities have superb implementations in the
      most pupular editors. However, these things never worked a 100%
      on the Emacs org mode, for example I decided that I wanted to
      work with web-mode rather than the default html mode for html
      code snippets, and although the standard html syntax coloring
      worked just fine, I needed to do a reopening of the file each
      time I added a new snippet when using the preferred web-mode
      highlighting.</dd>

    <dt>The status quo is hard to beat</dt>
    <dd>I had been programming on my own for all my life, but as I was
      about to embark in some associations I quickly realized that the
      people I was going to work with would have to learn to use the
      tools for literate programming that I had been using (Emacs +
      org mode). Although I give the highest praise I possible can to
      the Emacs editor and would recommend it to anyone I also
      understood that it has a high learning curve. I wanted the
      people I work with to have the option to begin contributing
      right away by using the tools they already mastered.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The solution was to turn literate programmin on it's
    head. Rather than writing the literate document containing the
    source code which would then be tangled out into their
    corresponding source files, we would write the code in their
    source files as it has pretty much always been done, but we would
    use comments to demarcates sections of code that we would later
    reference from an html file.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h1>Terminology</h1>

  <p>The Scythe program commands revolve around a directory where the
  user puts the files that will be needed in the process of creating
  the static site. This directory is referred to as the
  <code>input directory</code> or <code>Scythe
  directory</code> throughout the documentation.</p>

  <p>From the input directory, the program will make a directory that
    will contain the static site contents. This generated directory is
    the one that should be hosted through some sort of provider and is
    denominated as <code>output directory</code> throughout
    this website.</p>

  <p>The program catgorizes each of the files and directories
  contained in the input directory, there are only three possible
  categories:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Files or directories that are meant to give additional
      information or instructions to the Scythe programs and which
      will not appear in the output directory are said to be of type
      <code>special</code>.</li>
    <li>Files that have the .html extension will be
      processed by a template engine before being put in the output
      directory and are referred to as a being of type <code>page</code>.</li>
    <li>Any file or directory that does not fall in one of the above
      categories is simply copied as-is into the output
      directory. These files are said to be of type <code>verbatim</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The html tags the users put in their html pages which reference
  code are called <code>markup code references</code>.</p>

  <p>The lines of code that are delimited in a source file by a
  special kind of comment, and which are the referenced code are
  denominated <code>source code references</code>.</p>
