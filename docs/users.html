  <h1>Installation</h1>

  <p>First ensure that you have <a href="data.links.node">NodeJS</a> and the Node's package manager <a href="data.links.npm">NPM</a> installed.
    Then, in a console run the following command.</p>

  <pre>npm install -g pablo-munoz/scythe</pre>

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    The <code>-g</code> option of the installation command instructs
    NPM that you want the program to be installed globally, this will
    make it callable from your console no matter what the cwd is.

<div class="section">
  <h1>Preliminaries</h1>

  <p>A big part of the Scythe program is the use of the nunjucks
    template engine. If you have not used the nunjucks template engine
    before, or any template engine at all, we urge you to take a good
    look at the <a href="{{ data.links.nunjucks }}">nunjuck's documentation</a>
    before proceeding.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h1>Commands</h1>

  <p>
    The Scythe program comes with a number of commands that are
    detailed below, of these, the <code>mksite</code> command is the
    most important as it is the one that carries out the static
    website generation. The rest of the commands are limited to
    quality of life improvements.
  </p>


  <h2><span class="mono">mksite</span></h2>

  <p>The <code>mksite</code> command is the most important one. When
    called it will process all files and directories in the current
    working directory and create a static site out of them. By
    default, the generated static site will appear inside a <code>_site/</code> subdirectory,
    but this behaviour can be changed through configuration options.
    </p>


  <h2><span class="mono">mktemplate</span></h2>

  <p>The <code>mktemplate</code> command creates a default Scythe
    directory that can be used to create sites with the same look and
    feel as this very documentation. After running this command you
    end up with the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <code>docs/</code> directory. This will be the directory you should
      run the <code>mksite</code> command from. All the files listed
      next will be inside it.</li>
    <li>An empty <code>_config.yml</code>.</li>
    <li>The special directories <code>_data/</code>, <code>_layouts/</code> and <code>_includes/</code>.</li>
    <li>A <code>default.html</code> super template (inside of <code>_layouts/</code>).</li>
    <li>A <code>public/</code> verbatim directory that in turn
      contains a jquery file, toc.js which is our custom version of
      the toc.js library (used for automatically generating a table of
      contents for every page), solarized-dark.css which is one of
      highlight.js many themes for displaying source code and
      style.css, the main stylesheet.</li>
    <li>An <code>index.html</code> page-type file with 
      boilerplate code.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <h1>Structure of the input directory</h1>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h1>Referencing code</h1>

  <p>An important part of the application is it's ability to take code
    from your software project's source files and insert it in the
    html pages. In order to use this functionality you must understand
    two concepts: code regions and code references.</p>

  <h2>Code regions</h2>

  <p>We call code regions some contiguous lines of code that are
    delimited by (surrounded by) two comments with a special syntax.
    In order to distinguish between the many possible code regions
    that can exist within a single file you must give each region
    name. Region names can contain any characters you like, although
    we suggest to limit yourself to using to letters, numbers,
    underscores and spaces.</p>

  <p>In a source file, to mark a region of code, you put it in between
    two comments. The comment at the start of the region should have
    three consecutive plus symbols <code>+++</code>, followed by the
    name you want to give to the region. Similarly the comment at the
    end should have three consecutive minus symbols <code>---</code>
    and again, the name you are to give to the region.</p>

  <p>For example, let's say we have a small python source file, called <code>greetings.py</code>,
  with two functions, <code>greet_world</code> and <code>greet_user</code>.</p>

  {% call scythe.block('python') %}
def greet_world():
    print 'Hello, world!'

def greet_user():
    name = input('What is your name?: ')
    print 'Hello, ' + name 
  {% endcall %}

  <p>Now imagine we want to mark two regions, one that contains the
    <code>greet_world</code> function , which we will call
    "greet_world", while the other marks the <code>greet_user</code> function, which we will call
    "greet_user". Then our file would end up looking like this:</p>

    {% call scythe.block('python') %}
# +++ greet_world
def greet_world():
    print 'Hello, world!'
# --- greet_world

# +++ greet_region
def greet_user():
    name = input('What is your name?: ')
    print 'Hello, ' + name 
# --- greet_region
  {% endcall %}

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    We suggest that you keep your code region names simple and easy to
    remember. Using the same of the function or class they contain is
    usually the best way to go.
  </div>

  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    Some programming languages have multiple comment syntaxes.
    Usually one for single-line comments and another for multi-line
    ones. If this is your case, always go with the single-line
    comments, since the system has no knowledge of other comment
    styles.
  </div>

  <p>If the code region you are delimiting is small and has no blank
  lines in between, you can use an even simpler comment syntax to
  delimit it. For this special case you only use one comment, at the
  beginning of the region, followed by a plus and a minus symbol <code>+-</code>,
  followed by the name you will give to the reference.</p>

  <p>In the example shown above (the python file with the two
  functions) we could have used the simpler syntax to demarcate the
  regions. This is allowed since there are no blank lines inbetween
  the chunks of function code. Using the shortcut region syntax the
  file would look like this:</p>

  {% call scythe.block('python') %}
# +- greet_world
def greet_world():
    print 'Hello, world!'

# +- greet_region
def greet_user():
    name = input('What is your name?: ')
    print 'Hello, ' + name 
  {% endcall %}

  <h2>Code references</h2>

  <p>Code references are the counterparts of code regions. They are
    nunjucks macros that take the name of a region and the file where
    it should be looked up and, when processed by the template engine,
    get expanded into markup containing the actual lines of code in
    the code region they reference.</p>

  <p>Before being able to use the reference macro you must import it
  through a nunjucks import directive. We recommend you use the following:</p>

  {% raw %}<pre>{% import "scythe-macros.html" as scythe %}</pre>{% endraw %}

  <p>The <code>scythe-macros.html</code> file is located inside the <code>html</code> directory
  at the place where Scythe got installed. However it is automatically
  put within reach of the template engine, so you don't need to use
  it's absolute path or copy it into your input directory. In
  addition, we recommend that you import the macro in the<code>layouts/</code> files,
    so you don't have to type it in each one of your pages.</p>

  <p>Making a reference to a code region is a simple as calling the <code>scythe.reference</code> macro
  and passing as arguments the name of the desired code region and the
  file where it should be looked up, in this order.</p>

  <p>Continuing with the python source file example shown in the
    previous headline, if we were to include the code of the
    <code>greet_world</code> function, which in turn has been marked
    as a code region with the same name (<code>greet_world</code>),
    we would put the following macro directive in the desired of
    the page file where we want the code to appear.:</p>

  {% raw %}<pre>{{ scythe.reference("greet_world", "greetings.py") }}</pre>{% endraw %}

    <p>Sometimes you might want to have some code in your
      documentation that isn't part of the source code. For example,
      the python code of the example we have been working in isn't
      written in a source file, since it's merely for
      exemplification. To achieve the same code style of the code
      references for code you type directly into your webpages you
      must use a call of the <code>blocks</code> macro (this macro is
      part of the <code>scythe-macros.html</code> and
      gets imported with it). In this case since you wont be passing
      the name of a file from which a programing language can be
      inferred you must pass the language yourself as the only
      argument of the macro call and put your code inbetween.
    </p>

    <p>For example, the following code in the html page</p>:

    <pre>{% raw %}{% call scythe.block('js') %}
console.log("Some JavaScript code that isn't in a source file but was typed in directly.");
{% endcall %}{% endraw %}</pre>

    <p>... produces the following output:</p>

    {% call scythe.block('js') %}
console.log("Some JavaScript code that isn't in a source file but was typed in directly.");
    {% endcall %}
</div>
