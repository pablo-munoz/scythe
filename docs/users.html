  <h1>Installation</h1>

  <p>First ensure that you have <a href="data.links.node">NodeJS</a> and the Node's package manager <a href="data.links.npm">NPM</a> installed.
    The in a console run the following command.</p>

  <pre>npm install -g pablo-munoz/scythe</pre>

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    The <code>-g</code> option of the installation command instructs
    NPM that you want the program to be installed globally, this will
    make it callable from your console no matter what the cwd is.

<div class="section">
  <h1>Preliminaries</h1>

  <p>A big part of the Scythe program is the use of the nunjucks
    template engine. If you have not used the nunjucks template engine
    before, or any template engine at all, we urge you to take a good
    look at the <a href="{{ data.links.nunjucks }}">nunjuck's documentation</a>
    before proceeding.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h1>Commands</h1>

  <p>
    The Scythe program comes with a number of commands that are
    detailed below, of these, the <code>mksite</code> command is the
    most important as it is the one that carries out the static
    website generation. The rest of the commands are conerned only
    with quality of life improvements.
  </p>


  <h2><span class="mono">mksite</span></h2>

  <p>The <code>mksite</code> command is the most important one. When
    called it will process all files and directories in the current
    working directory and creates a static site out of them. By default,
    the generated static site will be inside the <code>_site/</code> special directory, at the
    first level of whatever directory you are running the command from.</p>


  <h2><span class="mono">mktemplate</span></h2>

  <p>The <code>mktemplate</code> command creates a default Scythe
    directory. After running it you end up with the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <code>docs/</code> directory. This will be the directory you should
      run the <code>mksite</code> command from. The following things
      listed next will all be inside of it.</li>
    <li>An empty <code>_config.yml</code>.</li>
    <li>The special directories <code>_data/</code>, <code>_layouts/</code> and <code>_includes/</code>.</li>
    <li>A <code>default.html</code> super template (inside of <code>_layouts/</code>).</li>
    <li>A <code>public/</code> verbatim directory is created for
      you. It will contain a jquery file, toc.js which is our custom
      version of the toc.js library (used for automatically generating
      a table of contents for every page), solarized-dark.css which is
      one of highlight.js many themes for the syntax coloring of the
      source code and style.css the main stylesheet.</li>
    <li>An <code>index.html</code> page-type file with some html
      boilerplate that already links to/includes the various
      JavaScripts and css files of <code>public/</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you run the <code>mksite</code> command with the cwd being the directory created by
    <code>mktemplate</code> you will end up with a static site with the same look and feel as this
    very documentation.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h1>Referencing code</h1>

  <p>An important part of the application is it's ability to take code
    from your software project's source files and insert it in the
    html pages, syntax highlighted and all. In order to use this
    functionality you must understand two concepts: code regions and
    code references.</p>

  <h2>Code regions</h2>

  <p>We call code regions some contiguous lines of code that are
    delimited by (surrounded by) two comments with a special syntax.
    In order to distinguish between the many possible code regions
    that can exist within a single file you must give each region
    name. Region names can contain any characters you like, although
    we suggest to limit yourself to using to letters, numbers,
    underscores and spaces.</p>

  <p>In a source file, to mark a region of code, you put it in between
    two comments. The comment at the start of the region should have
    three consecutive plus symbols <code>+++</code>, followed by the
    name you want to give to the region. Similarly the comment at the
    end should have three consecutive minus symbols <code>---</code>
    and again, the name you are to give to the region.</p>

  <p>For example, let's say we have a small python source file, called <code>greetings.py</code>,
  with two functions, <code>greet_world</code> and <code>greet_user</code>.</p>

  {% call scythe.block('python') %}
def greet_world():
    print 'Hello, world!'

def greet_user():
    name = input('What is your name?: ')
    print 'Hello, ' + name 
  {% endcall %}

  <p>Now imagine we want to mark two regions, one that contains the
    <code>greet_world</code> function code, which we will call
    "greet_world", while the other marks the code
    of the <code>greet_user</code> function, which we will call
    "greet_user". Then our file would end up looking like this:</p>

    {% call scythe.block('python') %}
// +++ greet_world
def greet_world():
    print 'Hello, world!'
// --- greet_world

// +++ greet_region
def greet_user():
    name = input('What is your name?: ')
    print 'Hello, ' + name 
// --- greet_region
  {% endcall %}

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    We suggest that you keep your code region names simple and easy to
    remember. Usually, using the same of the function or class they
    contain is the best way to go.
  </div>

  <div class="alert alert-warning">
    Some programming languages have multiple comment syntaxes.
    Usually one for single-line comments and another for multi-line
    ones. If this is your case, always go with the single-line
    comments, since the system has no knowledge of other comment
    styles.
  </div>

  <p>If the code region you are delimiting is small and has no blank
  lines in between, you can use an even simpler comment syntax to
  delimit it. For this special case you only one comment, at the
  beginning of the region, followed by a plus and a minus symbol <code>+-</code>,
  followed by the name you will give to the reference.</p>

  <p>In the example shown above, the python file with the two
  functions, we could have used the simpler syntax to delimit the
  regions. This is the case since they have no blank lines in
  between.</p>

  {% call scythe.block('python') %}
// +- greet_world
def greet_world():
    print 'Hello, world!'

// +- greet_region
def greet_user():
    name = input('What is your name?: ')
    print 'Hello, ' + name 
  {% endcall %}

  <h2>Code references</h2>

  <p>Code references are the counterparts to code regions. They exist
    within the html files that will make the pages of the generated
    static site and are implemented as a nunjucks macro (once again,
    if you don't know what a nunjucks macro is please go read the
    <a href="{{ data.links.nunjucks }}">nunjucks documentation</a>).</p>

  <p>Before being able to use the reference macro you must import it
  through a nunjucks import directive like this:</p>

  {% raw %}<pre>{% import "scythe-macros.html" as scythe %}</pre>{% endraw %}

  <p>The <code>scythe-macros.html</code> file is automatically put
  within reach of the template engine, so you don't need to use an
    absolute path or copy it into your input directory. We recommend that you do this import in the <code>layouts/</code> files,
    so you don't have to type it in each one of your pages.</p>

  <p>Making a reference to a code region is a simple as calling the <code>scythe.reference</code> macro
  and passing as arguments the name of the desired code region and the
  file where it should be looked up, in this order.</p>

  <p>Continuing with the python source file example shown in the
  previous headline, if we were to include the code of the <code>greet_world</code> function, which in
    turn has been marked as being the region with the same name, <code>greet_world</code>,
    we would put the following macro directive in the desired place of
    a page file:</p>

  {% raw %}<pre>{{ scythe.reference("greet_world", "greetings.py") }}</pre>{% endraw %}
</div>
