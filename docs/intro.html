  <h1>What is Scythe</h1>

  <p>Scythe is a NodeJS program that runs in the command line and
    whose purpose is to create static websites. It also has some
    functionalities that can be used to make literate programming
    documents.</p>

<div>
  <h1>Literate programming in 30 seconds</h1>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Literate programming is an approach to programming introduced
    by Donald Knuth in which a program is given as an explanation of
    the program logic in a natural language, such as English,
    interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code,
    from which a compilable source code can be generated.</p>

  <p>Also check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av0PQDVTP4A">video</a>
    which we regard as very insightful into why literate programming
    is important.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <h1>Motivation</h1>

  <p>This program was born out of the necessity of writing
    documentation for software projects. Since we adhere to the
    literate programming philosophy, we wanted our documentation to
    really get into the nitty-gritty of our code, explaining not only
    the "what" and the "how", but also the supremely important
    "why". In addition, the documentation should include the source
    code itself. In our ideal world a developer would read a paragraph
    that details what a function is intending to do and then read the
    function code itself.</p>

  <p>Other static website generators such as
    <a href="{{ data.links.jekyll }}">jekyll</a> or
    <a href="{{ data.links.wintersmith }}">wintersmith</a> would be
    sufficient for the job of writing a traditional style
    documentation. However, there is no way to include the snippets of
    code unless you write them out yourself, which would be a
    nightmare to mantain since whenever the code in the source files
    changed, the code in the documentation would have to be updated
    aswell. That's when we came up with the idea of marking up regions
    of code in the source files with comments and given them a name,
    then in the documentation we could write a reference to a code
    region with a particular name and the static site generator would
    take care of fetching the code and putting it in, as if we had
    typed it ourselves. This way, whenever the code in the source
    files changes the user just has to re-run the command to create
    the static site and everything will be synchronized.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <h1>Terminology</h1>

  <p>The Scythe program commands revolve around a directory where the
    user puts the files that will be needed in the process of creating
    the static site. This directory is referred to as the
    <code>input directory</code> or <code>Scythe
  directory</code> throughout the documentation.</p>

  <p>Afer the command to make the site is run a new directory will
    have been created, containing all the files that make up the
    static site, ready to be browsed or deployed. We refer to this
    directory as the <code>output directory</code>.</p>

  <p>The program catgorizes each of the files and directories
    contained in the input directory, there are only three possible
    categories:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Files or directories that are meant to give additional
      information or instructions to the Scythe programs and which
      will not appear in the output directory are said to be of type
      <code>special</code>.</li>
    <li>Files that have the .html extension will be
      processed by a template engine before being put in the output
      directory and are referred to as a being of type <code>page</code>.</li>
    <li>Any file or directory that does not fall in one of the above
      categories is simply copied as-is into the output
      directory. These files are said to be of type <code>verbatim</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Regions of code that are marked in the source files with the appropiate
    comment syntax as referred to as <code>code regions</code>,
    as you will learn later there are two kinds of code regions, and
    one is a shortcut form of the first that works for smaller and
    simpler cases.</p>

  <p>The code regions are referenced in the page-type files through
    the use of a macro.  We call this macros <code>code references</code>. Macros
    are part of the extra syntax that <a href="{{ data.links.nunjucks }}">nunjucks</a> allow
    us to use in the html files.</p>
